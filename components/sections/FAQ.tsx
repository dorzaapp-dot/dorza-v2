    q: "How much does it cost?",
    a: "Our Starter plan is $199/month plus a one-time $499 setup fee. Growth is $349/month + $799 setup. Pro is $549/month + $1,299 setup. Right now, founding clients get 50% off setup — so Starter setup is just $249. No lock-in contracts.",
  },
  {
    q: "I've been burned by agencies before — why is this different?",
    a: "We get it. Most agencies overpromise, underdeliver, and disappear for weeks. With Dorza, you see a working website within 24 hours of signing up — not a proposal, not a mood board. If you're not happy, you don't pay for the next month. Simple.",
  },
  {
    q: "I don't have time for this.",
    a: "Good — you don't need to make time. We handle everything. You fill out a 5-minute form, review what we build, and say go. After that, we run it. You'll hear from us once a month with a performance report.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast is 'live in 24 hours' really?",
    a: "We mean it. After you submit your intake form, your website is live within 24 hours. Google Business setup takes another 24-48 hours (Google has its own timeline). Social media profiles are live same day.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I want to cancel?",
    a: "Cancel any time, no questions asked. We don't do lock-in contracts. If you cancel, your website stays live for the rest of the month you've paid for. We'll hand over everything we've built — you own it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I just get one piece — say, only social media?",
    a: "Yes. Our Starter plan is website + Google Business only. If you only want social media management, talk to us — we can put together a custom package. We're flexible.",
